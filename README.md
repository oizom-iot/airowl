## Assembling the Airowl

The following is a cross sectional view of the Airowl dpicting its individual components and the way that they must be connected:

![Design Files](Images/14.png)

From left to right, we can observe the parts as follows:

1. Screws
2. [3D printed Black Case](Images/16.png)
3. [Printed circuit Board](Images/19.png)
4. M5 stack Core S3 SE
5. Sensirion SEN 54 sensor
6. [Front Cover](Images/15.png)

Ensure that the screws are connected correctly as depicted in the above picture, incase the screws are connected incorrectly, the longer screws might damage the physical cover of the Airowl.


On assembling the Airowl, it appears like depicted below:
